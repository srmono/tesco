# This results in errors

#MISSING

## Quantified Expressions

#SOME

SELECT name, address

## EVERY

SELECT name, address

## This query fails in Analytics

## Case Expressions

THEN "High"

#####################   Using Indexes for Analytics Queries
##########################################

## Indexes
## Expand the beers dataset in the Datasets panel on the right of the Analytics Workbench
## This includes the indexes available for the beers dataset
## Expand the breweries dataset - there is no index yet

## This query references many attributes
SELECT br.name AS beer_name, 
       bw.name AS brewery_name,
       bw.country, bw.city
FROM beers br JOIN breweries bw
ON META(bw).id = br.brewery_id
WHERE br.ibu > 20
ORDER BY br.name;

## Click on Plan and examine the "assign" and "project" phases for one of the datasets


#index creation requires temporary suspension of the shadowing process,
#although queries on the accumulated data can continue
#to be run while shadowing is on hold and the index is being built.

##

CREATE INDEX idx_beer_multi on beers(brewery_id:STRING, 
                                     ibu:DOUBLE, 
                                     name:STRING);

CREATE INDEX idx_brewery_name on breweries(name:STRING);


## Re-running this query will show no noticeable improvement in execution time
## since the datasets are too small
SELECT br.name AS beer_name, 
       bw.name AS brewery_name,
       bw.country, bw.city
FROM beers br JOIN breweries bw

############ Failovers and Cluster Rebalancing
####################################


## Head to Settings in the UI and disable auto-failover

## Go to the Buckets section and set the #replicas for the beer-sample bucket to 2
## Head to the Servers section and rebalance the nodes


## Simulate node failure (hard failover)

## After the rebalance concludes, shut down one of the hosts from the cloud service
## . From the Servers section, the node will appear off (and the Failover button will appear)
## . Try running the query again (it will likely fail)
## . From the Server section, hit Failover for the failed node
## . Re-run the query (it should run now)

## Re-add a node using the REST API
curl -u admin:bvsrao \
http://host-01:8091/controller/addNode \
-d hostname=10.0.0.7 \
-d user=admin \
-d password=bvsrao \
-d services=kv,index,n1ql,fts 

## Start the node from the Cloud console
## From the Servers section in the UI, the node will soon appear responsive
## Do an Add Back: Delta Recovery and do a rebalance
## While the rebalance is taking place, run the query (it should run)


## . Go to Settings and enable the Auto-failover option 
##		- set it for 2 events
##		- save changes
## . Again, shut down one of the hosts and check the Servers section (the node will appear off)
## . Wait for the failover to occur automatically
## . Re-run the query (it should run)
## . After the auto-failover, revive the downed host and observe that the Servers section shows the node is available
## . Opt for a full recovery and then hit Rebalance
## . Re-run the query (it should run)

## Soft / graceful failover
## Simulate taking down a node for maintenance

## . From the Servers section, select a node and click Failover
##		- Choose the "Graceful" failover option
##		- Rebalance the nodes and run the query while it's happening
##		- Re-run query after the rebalance - should run quicker

##	Re-add the node with a Delta Recovery and rebalance

##		e. Check box to require TLS
##		f. Sender is cloud.user@bvsrao.com. Recipient is alice@bvsrao.com
##		g. Send a test email (allow access to less secure 3rd-party apps)
##		h. Leave all boxes checked for when to send out alerts
##		i. Save changes

## . Bring down one of the nodes by stopping it
## . The auto failover should take place and an email should be sent to the recipient
